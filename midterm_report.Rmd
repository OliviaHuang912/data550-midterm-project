# Introduction

This report presents an analysis of COVID-19 data focusing on patient demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. The purpose is to identify patterns that may inform health policy and care strategies.

# Demographic Analysis
## Demographic Table
The table below provides a summary of demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients, grouped by age group and gender.

```{r, table1}
# Load the demographic summary table
table_Demographic <- readRDS(here::here("output/output_demographic", "table_Demographic.rds"))

# Display the table
table_Demographic
```

## Age Distribution Plot
The plot below shows the age distribution of COVID-19 patients, allowing us to see how ages are spread across the population in this dataset.
```{r, table2}
# Load the age distribution plot
plot_age_distribution <- readRDS(here::here("output/output_demographic", "plot_age_distribution.rds"))

# Display the plot
plot_age_distribution
```

## Classification Across Age Groups
This plot shows the distribution of COVID-19 patients across different classifications, segmented by age group.
```{r, table3}
# Load the classification by age group plot
plot_class_age_bar <- readRDS(here::here("output/output_demographic", "plot_class_age_bar.rds"))

# Display the plot
plot_class_age_bar

```
## Conclusion
The analysis of COVID-19 patient demographics and clinical classifications provides insights into the age distribution, comorbidities, and clinical classifications of patients, with a focus on how these attributes vary by age.

# Comorbidity Analysis

## Counts of Yes and No Responses for Each Condition
This bar chart visualizes the prevalence of various pre-existing health conditions among COVID-19 patients. Each bar represents a condition, with counts for "Yes" (patients with the condition) and "No" (patients without the condition) displayed in red and blue, respectively.

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(here)

data_clean <- read_csv(here::here("data", "data_clean.csv"))
# Prepare data
condition_data <- data_clean %>%
  select(PNEUMONIA, PREGNANT, DIABETES, COPD, ASTHMA, INMSUPR, 
         HIPERTENSION, CARDIOVASCULAR, RENAL_CHRONIC, OTHER_DISEASE, 
         OBESITY, TOBACCO) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "condition", values_to = "status") %>%
  mutate(status = factor(status, levels = c("Yes", "No"))) %>%
  group_by(condition, status) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Create the bar chart
ggplot(condition_data, aes(x = condition, y = count, fill = status)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(title = "Counts of Yes and No Responses for Each Condition",
       x = "Condition",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Status") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

## Summary of Prevalence Table for Pre-Existing Conditions
The prevalence table provides a summary of the number of COVID-19 patients with and without various pre-existing conditions, along with the calculated prevalence of each condition (as a percentage) among the patient population.

```{r, table4, echo= FALSE}

# Calculate prevalence
data_with_prevalence <- data_clean %>%
  select(PNEUMONIA, PREGNANT, DIABETES, COPD, ASTHMA, INMSUPR, 
         HIPERTENSION, CARDIOVASCULAR, RENAL_CHRONIC, OTHER_DISEASE, 
         OBESITY, TOBACCO) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~factor(., levels = c("Yes", "No")))) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "condition", values_to = "status") %>%
  group_by(condition, status) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = status, values_from = count, values_fill = list(count = 0)) %>%
  mutate(prevalence = Yes / (Yes + No) * 100)

# Create a table with counts and prevalence
condition_data_table <- data_with_prevalence %>%
  select(condition, Yes, No, prevalence) %>%
  rename(Count_Yes = Yes, Count_No = No, Prevalence_Yes = prevalence)

# View the table with counts and prevalence
print(condition_data_table)
```
