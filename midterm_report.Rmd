# Introduction

This report presents an analysis of COVID-19 data focusing on patient demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. The purpose is to identify patterns that may inform health policy and care strategies.

# Demographic Analysis
## Demographic Table
The table below provides a summary of demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients, grouped by age group and gender.

```{r, table1}
# Load the demographic summary table
table_Demographic <- readRDS(here::here("output/output_demographic", "table_Demographic.rds"))

# Display the table
table_Demographic
```

## Age Distribution Plot
The plot below shows the age distribution of COVID-19 patients, allowing us to see how ages are spread across the population in this dataset.
```{r, table2}
# Load the age distribution plot
plot_age_distribution <- readRDS(here::here("output/output_demographic", "plot_age_distribution.rds"))

# Display the plot
plot_age_distribution
```

## Classification Across Age Groups
This plot shows the distribution of COVID-19 patients across different classifications, segmented by age group.
```{r, table3}
# Load the classification by age group plot
plot_class_age_bar <- readRDS(here::here("output/output_demographic", "plot_class_age_bar.rds"))

# Display the plot
plot_class_age_bar

```
## Conclusion
The analysis of COVID-19 patient demographics and clinical classifications provides insights into the age distribution, comorbidities, and clinical classifications of patients, with a focus on how these attributes vary by age.
